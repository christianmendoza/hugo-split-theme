## Installation

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/christianmendoza/hugo-split-theme

For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.


## Getting started

After installing the Split theme successfully it requires a just a few more steps to get your site finally running.


### The config file

Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](//github.com/christianmendoza/hugo-split-theme/tree/master/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called [`config.toml`](//github.com/christianmendoza/hugo-split-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml). To use it, copy the [`config.toml`](//github.com/christianmendoza/hugo-split-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) in the root folder of your Hugo site. Feel free to customize this theme as you like.


### Use an image

Set `enable` to `true`. Add your image to the `static` folder and change `file` to the location of your image accordingly. By default the image position is centered, however you can specify your own by supplying `position` with a valid CSS position.

```toml
[[params.visual.image]]
  enable = true
  file = "images/background.jpg"
  position = "center center"
```


### Use a video

First, disable the image by setting `enable` to `false` in `[params.visual.image]`.

Second, enable the video by setting `enable` to `true` in `[params.visual.video]`.

You can either use a video that you host or one that is on YouTube.

##### Use your own video

Add your video to the `static` folder and change `file` to the location of your video accordingly. Make sure you delete `youtubeId` or comment it out. 

```toml
[[params.visual.image]]
  enable = false
  ...
[params.visual.video]
  enable = true
  mute = true
  file = "videos/background.mp4"
  # youtubeId = "dk9uNWPP7EA"
```

##### Use a YouTube video

Get the ID of the YouTube video and add it to `youtubeId`. Make sure you delete `file` or comment it out. 

```toml
[[params.visual.image]]
  enable = false
  ...
[params.visual.video]
  enable = true
  mute = true
  # file = "videos/background.mp4"
  youtubeId = "dk9uNWPP7EA"
```

##### Additional settings

Set `mute` to `true` if you want the video to play muted and `false` if you want the sound. The video is coded to autoplay and loop. If you want to change that the code can be found in [`layouts/partials/video.html`](//github.com/christianmendoza/hugo-split-theme/tree/master/layouts/partials/video.html).


### Add content

`name`, `tagline` and `bio` corresponds to their respective text in the content section. Use markdown in `bio` to add any links.

```toml
[params.content]
  name = "Jenny Jones"
  tagline = "Designer. Stylist. Nomad."
  bio = "Donec at libero id lectus porta dapibus eu in nibh. Cras id mauris sapien. Fusce viverra [luctus urna](#) ac rutrum. Duis semper elit eu mi facilisis eleifend. Donec semper, [ipsum in](#) malesuada congue, [purus sem](#) ullamcorper massa, sit amet lacinia nibh enim sed massa."
```


### Add links

You can have up to 3 column lists in the links section. `heading` is the list heading text. For the text links `text` is the link text and `url` is the link url. Follow the same snippet structure to add more links to a list. If you only want 1 or 2 lists, just remove the link list snippet you don't want.

This is what generates one link list:

```toml
# Links List #1
[[params.links]]
  [params.links.list1]
    heading = "Connect"
  
    [[params.links.list1.link]]
      text = "Blog"
      url = "#"
  
    [[params.links.list1.link]]
      text = "Email"
      url = "#"
  
    [[params.links.list1.link]]
      text = "Newsletter"
      url = "#"
```


### Add metadata

`name` and `description` metadata helps search engines with how to display your site in search results. `shareImage` and `twitterHandle` help improves how your content is displayed when your site is shared across social media sites.

```toml
name = "Jenny Jones"
description = "Split is a centrally-divided layout for a professional online presence with a big image or video left with alongside content."
shareImage = "images/social.jpg"
twitterHandle = "onepagelove"
```


### Add favicon
Replace [`static/favicon.ico`](//github.com/christianmendoza/hugo-split-theme/tree/master/static/favicon.ico) with your favicon. If you don't want just delete `favicon.ico` and the line below.

```toml
favicon = "favicon.ico"
```


### Add copyright
Set `copyright` with the text you want for your copyright.

```toml
copyright = "&copy;2017 Your Name"
```


### Add Google Analytics

Enable Google Analytics by adding your tracking id to `googleAnalytics`. Leave empty or remove if you don't want.

```toml
googleAnalytics = "UA-XXXXXXXX-1"
```


### Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

    $ hugo server

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
